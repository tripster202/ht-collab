// start
initiate https server thread to receive TradingView RSI data (webhook)
    store TradingView data as global dictionary {coin:rsi_value}

// pull all data from persistent database
// database options
//    - local/remote SQL
//    - Google Sheets
//    - Google Firebase (or similar)
from database db:
    get all bank data
    get all tide data

// continuous loop
while(True):

    // holds the outside "while(True)" loop for N minutes through the use of time.wait(1.0)
    while(time_val < n_minutes): time.wait(1.0)

    get all price data from coinbase and store locally
    get all volume data from coinbase and store locally

    check if any sell limits are fulfilled
        if fulfilled
            pull transaction information using order_id
            reset count to zero

    // buyd conditions
    // average daily volume > $5 million
    // RSI < 35.0
    // First buy under the threshold **
    check if any coins meet the conditions to buy
        if buyd conditions met
            increment count by 1
            determine dollar amount to buy ($100.00 * (multiplier ^ count))
            send market order to coinbase
            receive transaction details from coinbase (order_id, size, price, fee)
            store transaction details (order_id, size, price, fee)
            re-compute new average price

    update bank
    update tide

// ** Algorithm will only buy once while RSI < 35.0 -- The algorithm must wait for the RSI to go above the threshold (RSI < 35.0) before it can then buy an additional position -- This prevents the algorithm from buying a whole group of positions at once

// footnote: I like to write "buy" as "buyd" because "buyd" and "sell" are both the same length with four characters. Slight obsession for symmetry.
